# smart-ac
 Analyzes outdoor and indoor temperatures and programs smart thermostats to maximize comfort and energy efficiency. 


Future Improvements

- [ ]  Schedule AC based on ambient and external temperatures
- [ ]  Store historical data and compare to future forecasts to intelligently predict and change the temperature, thereby minimizing energy use
- [ ]  Store approximate energy use based on energy price (scraped from the power department, or equivalent) and estimated usage based on timing
- [ ]  Apply the Newton's Law of Cooling to the predictive model
- [ ]  Allow hashing of the user credentials
- [ ]  Allow use of different AC modes (e.g., Fan)
